## Python

**[`^    back to top    ^`](#table-of-contents)**

[Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.

## Rust

**[`^    back to top    ^`](#table-of-contents)**

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety—ensuring that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages.
